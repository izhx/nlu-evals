## `nlu-evals`

Evaluate BERT-style encoder models based on `transformers` library, currently support:
 - [GLUE](https://aclanthology.org/W18-5446/)
 - [XTREME](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/hu20b.html) and [XTREME-R](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.802/)


### Environment

```shell
conda create -n nlu_eval python=3.11
conda activate nlu_eval

pip install 'transformers>=4.41.0' 'datasets<2.20.0,>=2.19.0' accelerate evaluate scikit-learn seqeval pytrec_eval
```

### Usage

Directly run each script under `scripts/`, and those with dependencies will be automatically executed in order.
After completion, use the script under `tools/` to obtain the result statistics.

Run all datasets:
```shell
# Run all subsets sequentially
for (( group = 0; group <= 5; group += 1 ))
do
    bash scripts/entry.sh Alibaba-NLP/gte-multilingual-mlm-base results/mgte-mlm-base $group
done

# Get result
python tools/gather_glue.py results/mgte-mlm-base
python tools/gather_xtreme.py results/mgte-mlm-base
```


### Offline Setting

Please cache all required datasets manually and then set environment variables:
1. `HF_HOME="./.cache_hf"`
2. `HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE="1"`

Then
```
HF_HOME="./.cache_hf" HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE="1" bash scripts/entry.sh Alibaba-NLP/gte-multilingual-mlm-base results/mgte-mlm-base 0
```
